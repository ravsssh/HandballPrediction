# Prediction of the number of goal in German Handball League Player


I create 12 goal prediction model for each position in Handball except Goalkeeper using radial basis function neural network to predict number of goal. 
Every position have two model distinguished by two input parameter which is shot attempt and shot accuracy for every type of shot in handball.
With that 12 model of goal prediction i created analytics of the best shot type for each position using sensitivity analysis.

## Description

Based on previous research related to the implementation of machine learning in Handball [(Oytun et al., 2020)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9122509). Radial Basis Function Neural Network outperform Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Backpropagation Neural Network and Long Short-term Memory in MAE, MSE and R-squared.
Inspired by [(Oytun et al., 2020)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9122509) i used RBFNN in predicting the number of goals scored by handball players for each position.
