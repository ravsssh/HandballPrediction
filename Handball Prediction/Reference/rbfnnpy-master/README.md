=======

**rbfnnpy** module is an implementation of RBF Neural Network model training, dump and prediction for Python.

## Requirements
  - NumPy
  - h5py

## Examples

Files for model training: 
  - ` train.csv ` contains feature vector for each sample 
  - ` target.csv ` contains samples predicted values for each sample

File ` train_predict.py ` contains an example of model training and its usage for prediction.

File ` load_predict.py ` contains an example of model parameters dump and its usage for prediction.
